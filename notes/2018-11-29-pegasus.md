### Topic

Differential privacy; Streaming data

### Motivation

Releasing continuous query answers on real time streams under differential privacy.

### Approach

![The framework of PeGaSus algorithm](figures/PeGaSus-1.png)

*Perturb-Group-Smooth (PeGaSus)* based Stream Release:

- *Perturber*: consumes the input stream, adds noise to each incoming element of the stream, and generates a stream of noisy counts;

- Data-adaptive *Grouper*: consumes the input stream, identifies stable uniform regions in the stream and computes a partition of the data received so far;

- Query specific *Smoother*: performs post-processing, combines the output of the *Perturber* and *Grouper* to generate the final private estimate of a query answer at each time step.

***Perturber***:

Laplace Mechanism

_**Deviation-based Grouper (DBG)**_:

A differentially private method for online partitioning which chooses partitions that approximately minimizes a quality score based on deviation.

When a new data <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_t" title="c_t" /> arrives at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t" title="t" />, we check the status of the last group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G" title="G" /> from the previous partition <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_{t-1}" title="P_{t-1}" />. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G" title="G" /> is closed, we put <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_t" title="c_t" /> into a new open group and reset the noisy threshold. Otherwise, we compute the deviation of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C_t[G&space;\cup&space;\left&space;\{&space;t&space;\right&space;\}]" title="C_t[G \cup \left \{ t \right \}]" /> and compare a noisy version of the deviation value with the noisy threshold. If the noisy deviation is smaller than the noisy threshold, we add <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left&space;\{&space;t&space;\right&space;\}" title="\left \{ t \right \}" /> into the open <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G" title="G" />. Otherwise, we add a new group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left&space;\{&space;t&space;\right&space;\}" title="\left \{ t \right \}" /> into the partition and close both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G" title="G" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left&space;\{&space;t&space;\right&space;\}" title="\left \{ t \right \}" />.

At each time step, it calls `PRUNE`. Then, for each aggregation, if it has been pruned. it simply outputs a count of 0. Otherwise, it applies the PeGaSus algorithm to the stream where the privacy budget passed to *Perturber* and *Grouper* is adjusted based on what has been pruned and the height of the tree.

The function `PRUNE` checks each aggregation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?agg&space;\in&space;AGG" title="agg \in AGG" /> from level 1 to level <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h" title="h" />. If the current <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?agg" title="agg" /> has been pruned, all its children are automatically pruned. Otherwise, we compare this aggregation's current count, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_t" title="c_t" />(<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?agg" title="agg" />), against a user-specified threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta" title="\beta" />. If the count is below threshold, it prunes all the children of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?agg" title="agg" />. Further, the privacy budget that would have been spent on the descendants is saved.
