### Topic

Differential privacy; Streaming data

### Motivation



### Approach

*Perturb-Group-Smooth* technique (PeGaSus):
*Perturber* generates a stream of noisy counts, a data-adaptive *Grouper* identifies stable uniform regions in the stream and computes a partition of the data received so far, and a query specific *Smoother* combines the output of the *Perturber* and *Grouper* to generate the final private estimate of a query answer at each time step.
